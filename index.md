I am a Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science and Engineering Department of the Chinese University of Hong Kong, supervised by Prof. [Eric Lo](https://www.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/~ericlo/), expected to graduate in 2023. 
My research mainly focuses on transaction processing in distributed databases. 
In particular, I'm interested in designing efficient and practical protocols including concurrency control, atomic commit, and replication protocols for typical DBs or blockchains.
